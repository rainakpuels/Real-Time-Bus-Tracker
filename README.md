# Description of the project:

In this project, we imported a map of Cambridge, MA from Mapbox. We also used data for the location of bus stops along Route 1 from the MBTA. By clicking the botton in the top left, the user sees an animated marker that moves along the bus stops. 

We started with the same source code, but I changed the style of the map, changed the color of the marker to match, and customized the button that starts the anination. 

# How to Run: 

The code is ready to run as is. The only update you'll need is your own Mapbox access token. 

# Roadmap of future improvements: 

It would be helpful to import data from the MBTA about other buslines in the area, so someone could see the transfers more clearly. I could also see this code being improved if bikelines were overlaid onto the bus lines, so passengers knew when to look out for cyclists.
