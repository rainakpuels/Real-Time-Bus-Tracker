# About:

 [Click here to see the Real Time Bus Tracker in action.](https://rainakpuels.github.io/Real-Time-Bus-Tracker)

This is an exercise developed during MIT xPro Full Stack Professional Certificate in Coding.

Using Google Maps API, MBTA API, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, we created a "Real Time Bus Tracker" that uses data from the MBTA to track the live locations of its Route 1 busses. It updates every 10 seconds.

This code uses asynchronous functions, the "await" operator, and promises.

# How to Run

If you download all the necessary files in one folder, the "index.html" should run in your browser.

To customize, you can sign up for your own Google Maps API. That will allow you to create your own Map ID, which you can style through their platform. 

# Roadmap of Future Improvemenets

No further development is expected.
